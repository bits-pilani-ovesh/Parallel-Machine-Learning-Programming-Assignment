        "without sacrificing model accuracy. By distributing gradient computation\n",

        "leading to faster convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the observed speedup is sub-linear as the number of workers increases.\n",
        "This behavior can be attributed to process creation overhead, inter-process\n",
        "communication costs, and memory copying involved in gradient aggregation.\n",
        "Additionally, Python’s multiprocessing introduces overhead that limits\n",
        "scalability compared to lower-level parallel frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of synchronous gradient updates ensures model consistency and stable\n",
        "convergence, but it also introduces synchronization delays, as all workers\n",
        "must complete their computation before each update. Asynchronous updates could\n",
        "potentially reduce waiting time but may introduce gradient staleness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the implementation validates the effectiveness of a parameter\n",
